# route_blocker
Demo app presented at the Long Night of Science Berlin 2016, 2017 and 2018

## Setup

The app calls a special edition of the [ExCELL Routing Service](https://github.com/excell-mobility/routing_service). You need to check out the `cebit` branch to get the API that can `block` or `unblock` road elements.

## Flyer

More information about the app itself can be found on this [flyer](https://projekt.beuth-hochschule.de/fileadmin/projekt/magda/flyer_lndw.pdf).
